    "Linear regression is a statistical technique that makes certain assumptions about the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Violation of these assumptions can lead to biased or unreliable results. The following are the main assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables is linear. This means that the change in the dependent variable is proportional to the change in the independent variables.\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset are independent of each other. This means that there is no systematic relationship between the residuals (the difference between the predicted and actual values) and any of the independent variables.\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This means that the spread of the residuals is consistent across all values of the independent variables.\n",
    "Normality: The residuals are normally distributed around a mean of zero. This means that most of the residuals are close to zero, with fewer residuals further away from zero.\n",
    "No multicollinearity: There is no high correlation between any two independent variables in the dataset. This means that each independent variable contributes unique information to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, we can perform several diagnostic tests, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatterplots: We can create scatterplots to visually inspect whether there is a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable.\n",
    "Residual plots: We can create residual plots to check for independence, homoscedasticity, and normality of the residuals.\n",
    "Cook's distance: We can use Cook's distance to identify influential observations that may be affecting the results of our analysis.\n",
    "Variance inflation factor (VIF): We can use VIF to check for multicollinearity between independent variables.\n",
    "Shapiro-Wilk test: We can use this test to check for normality of the residuals.\n",

The gradient tells us the direction in which the cost function is increasing the most, so we adjust the parameter values in the opposite direction to decrease the cost function.\n",

    "The amount by which we adjust the parameter values is determined by a learning rate, which controls how quickly we move towards the minimum.
